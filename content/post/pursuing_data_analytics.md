As a Technical Program Manager with experience in mobile development and robotics projects, I’ve come to realize the immense power of data. While working on these projects, I followed the traditional waterfall process, where one task followed another until the project was completed. However, I soon learned that strong problem-solving skills were essential to identify and solve problems before delving deep into the project.

In robotics development, data management skills were even more critical. It was crucial to understand how to collect and analyze data to identify issues and improve the project. Nowadays, data is ubiquitous, and it’s no longer enough to rely on gut feelings or hearsay to make informed decisions. Data is necessary to validate ideas, solve problems, and drive business outcomes.

To explore my passion for data analytics and AI further, I’ve decided to switch gears and would love to explore the carrer in Business Analysis Program Manager or Product Manager. I have enrolled in the Google Data Analytics certificate program on Coursera to quickly gain an understanding of how data affects decision-making and how to obtain the right data for problem-solving.

As a Technical Program Manager, I believe these skills are vital and will help me identify and solve problems effectively. In particular, I find the data collection, cleaning, and processing aspects of data analytics the most intriguing. These aspects are crucial because without clean and processed data, it’s impossible to perform accurate analysis and visualization.

Moreover, I understand that managing AI, ML, and data projects requires a different approach than software development. Effective project management skills can optimize these types of projects, ensuring resources are used efficiently, goals are clearly defined, and timelines are met. By applying project management principles to data-related initiatives, I’ll be better equipped to identify the right data sources and manage the project lifecycle from data collection to analysis and visualization.

In conclusion, I believe that it’s never too late to pursue your passion and reinvent yourself. If you’re considering a career change or interested in data analytics and AI, I encourage you to take the leap and start learning. The journey may not be easy, but the rewards are worth it.
