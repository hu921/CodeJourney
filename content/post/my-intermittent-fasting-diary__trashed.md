I am not an expert of Intermittent Fasting; however, I started or inspired by Marcus, my brother-in-law. It really worked on him.  I don't know how to start this, but I am going to record what I eat for now. It's been a week, I only lose for 4.4 pounds (2 kg around). Here's my IF 16/8 which means only eat during 8 hours (around 12pm-7pm) and not eat anything besides coffee, tea, water during 16 hours. (I will keep update...) 

Day 1

Day 3  (normally is one meal a day with little bit of snake during 8 hours, but today I got really hungry, so I decided to have shrimp salad before the meal) \[caption id="attachment\_611" align="alignnone" width="435"\]![shrimp salad](https://sarahu.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_0979-e1507786926604.jpg) Shrimp Salad\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment\_612" align="alignnone" width="438"\]![Dumpling and ground pork](https://sarahu.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_0987-e1507787001957.jpg) Dumpling and ground pork\[/caption\] Day 4 \[caption id="attachment\_613" align="alignnone" width="562"\]![Hotpot](https://sarahu.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_1002-e1507787136378.jpg?w=910) Hotpot\[/caption\] Day 5 \[caption id="attachment\_614" align="alignnone" width="567"\]![Chinese cruise](https://sarahu.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_1005-e1507787208609.jpg) Chinese Cruise 1. green beens with Shrimp 2.
