I am not an expert of Intermittent Fasting; however, I started or inspired by Marcus, my brother-in-law. It really worked on him.  I don't know how to start this, but I am going to record what I eat for now. It's been a week, I only lose for 4.4 pounds (2 kg around). Here's my IF 16/8 which means only eat during 8 hours (around 12pm-7pm) and not eat anything besides coffee, tea, water during 16 hours. (I will keep update...) 

**Day 1** 
![Steak with green beens](/img/fest-d1.jpg) Steak and Green Beans

**Day 2**
![Hamburger](/img/fest-d2.jpg) A huge humburger

**Day 3**  
![Shrimp Salad](/img/fest-d3.jpg) Normally is one meal a day with little bit of snake during 8 hours, but today I got really hungry, so I decided to have shrimp salad before the meal

**Day 4**
