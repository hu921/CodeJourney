Hey there, welcome to my digital space!

I'm a tech nomad navigating the realms of writing and front-end coding. By day, I'm a seasoned Technical Program Manager in Technology, Robotics, and Software Development, always hungry for fresh challenges. My mind's a whirlwind of ideas, fueled by an insatiable curiosity and an unwavering passion for exploration.

I thrive on unplanned travel adventures, reveling in surprises, meeting diverse people, and savoring the richness of different cuisines. Learning about various cultures through their food and connecting with people from all corners of the globe is my jam.

For me, technology isn't just a tool; it's a playground where creativity and innovation collide. I'm constantly scouting for new ways to weave tech into enhancing my writing, coding finesse, and overall digital experience.

Life, to me, is an ongoing masterclass. I eagerly embrace challenges that thrust me beyond my comfort zone. Please count me in, whether it's mastering fresh technology, untangling complex problems, or embarking on a culinary escapade with exotic ingredients!
